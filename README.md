# Kernel-Base
This project was a way for me to explore how a kernel works. I built a simple text terminal with three commands(hello, info, and exit), and managed to get it to boot completely.

# How to use
1. Make sure you compile it first with the "compile" script
2. Run it with the "run" script.

# Requirements
- GCC
- grub-mkrescue
- qemu-system-x86_64
